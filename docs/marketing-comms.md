# Marketing Communications Plan

## Phase 1: Pre-launch foundation

- Publish homepage and waitlist on `marketermcp.com`.
- Publish docs preview, blog, and FAQ.
- Prepare launch narrative:
  - Why Marketer MCP
  - Why Budget Buddy first
  - How teams connect safely
- Complete legal pages (privacy, terms, security).
- Deploy SEO foundation: meta tags, OG/Twitter cards, JSON-LD, robots.txt, sitemap.xml.
- Set up analytics and conversion tracking on waitlist form.

## Phase 2: Teaser campaign (weeks 1-2)

- 3-5 teaser posts across X and LinkedIn.
- Founder post with ideal customer profile (agency and in-house variants).
- One short demo video clip highlighting Budget Buddy flow.
- Seed community posts in AI/automation and marketing-ops groups.

## Phase 3: Launch week

- Site banner + email announcement + social launch thread.
- Activate paid media: SEM brand + category campaigns, LinkedIn segments.
- Community posts in relevant AI/builder channels.
- Public beta intake form with clear response timeline.

## Phase 4: Post-launch momentum (ongoing)

- Weekly updates with shipped improvements.
- Share early user wins and case studies.
- Publish monthly changelog and reliability updates.
- Bi-weekly ad creative refresh to combat fatigue.

## Organic social cadence

- Wednesday: Blog post share or data point from marketing ops research.
- Friday: Founder perspective or customer conversation takeaway.

### X (2 posts/week)
- Tuesday: Quick tip or workflow example using MCP tools.
- Thursday: Thread or blog cross-post with visual hook.

### Content types
- 2-3 short demo clips (Budget Buddy flow, roadmap preview, "how it works").
- 1 explainer thread per launch milestone.
- Community seeding in: MarketingOps community, Lenny's Newsletter community, AI/builder Slack groups, relevant subreddits (r/marketing, r/PPC, r/analytics).

## Copy framework

Use this sequence for website and campaigns:

1. Pain statement
2. Promise
3. Proof
4. Call to action

See `copy-system.md` for agency and in-house copy variants.
See `positioning-agency.md` and `positioning-inhouse.md` for ICP briefs.

## Commercial model messaging

The launch narrative must clearly communicate the free-to-enterprise journey:

- **Small businesses and creators:** Free Starter tier with 500 executions/month. No credit card required.
- **Growing teams:** Growth tier with usage-based pricing, higher limits, and email support.
- **Enterprise:** Dedicated support, custom SLA, volume pricing, and security review support.

Key messaging rules:
- Lead with free access to reduce friction.
- Show upgrade path only after demonstrating value (in-product and in comms).
- Enterprise messaging targets procurement and ops leads, not just practitioners.

See `pricing.md` for full tier architecture.
See `policies/fair-use.md` for free tier acceptable use.
See `policies/enterprise-sla.md` for enterprise support scope.
See `api/access-tiers.md` for technical tier enforcement details.
