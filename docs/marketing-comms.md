# Marketing Communications Plan

## Phase 0: MCP ecosystem foundation (before launch)

- Publish `llms.txt` at website root for AI-system discoverability (GEO).
- Extend homepage JSON-LD with `WebAPI` schema for structured AI citation.
- Submit Marketer MCP to MCP directories in priority order:
  - Official MCP registry (`modelcontextprotocol/servers` on GitHub).
  - Glama, Smithery, PulseMCP, mcp.so, Composio.
- Optimize directory listings: human-readable descriptions, clear install instructions, category tags (`marketing`, `budget`, `analytics`, `campaign-management`).
- Enable GitHub Discussions (Q&A, Ideas, Show and Tell, Announcements).
- Add `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root for transparent release history.

See `mcp-growth-playbook.md` for full directory list, listing optimization, and GEO strategy.

## Phase 1: Pre-launch foundation

- Publish homepage and waitlist on `marketermcp.com`.

- Complete legal pages (privacy, terms, security).

- Set up analytics and conversion tracking on waitlist form.

## Phase 2: Teaser campaign (weeks 1-2)
