# Positioning Brief: In-House Track

## Ideal customer profile

In-house marketing teams (3-30 people) at growth-stage or mid-market companies running their own media mix across paid search, paid social, display, video, and organic. The day-to-day operator is a marketing ops lead, growth marketer, or demand gen manager who owns channel budgets and reports to a CMO or VP Marketing.

## Pain

- Budget pacing lives in spreadsheets updated weekly — surprises show up too late.
- Channel allocation decisions are gut-feel because pulling cross-platform data takes too long.
- No standard QA process for UTMs, creative specs, or campaign naming conventions.

## Promise

Connect once to Marketer MCP and get instant budget pacing, allocation recommendations, and campaign QA baked into the AI tools your team already uses — no new login, no new dashboard.

## Proof

- Budget Buddy surfaces over-budget risk the moment spend data changes.
- Attribution QA catches UTM mismatches before campaigns go live.
- Public-ready security guardrails mean IT approves the connection, not blocks it.

## Hero copy variant (A/B test)

**Headline:** "Connect once. Never miss a budget signal again."

**Sub-headline:** "Marketer MCP plugs real-time spend pacing, channel allocation, and campaign QA into the AI workflows your team already runs."

## CTA variant

- Primary: "Get early access for your team"
- Secondary: "Read the quickstart"

## Key differentiators for in-house messaging

1. Single connection replaces multiple dashboard logins for budget visibility.
2. Workflow-native: fits into existing AI assistants without adding another tool to the stack.
3. Security-first design with token auth and rate limits satisfies IT and finance review.
