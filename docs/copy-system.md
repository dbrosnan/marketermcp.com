## CTA hierarchy

1. **Primary CTA**: "Get early access" / "Join the beta" — purple filled button
2. **Secondary CTA**: "See how it works" / "Read the quickstart" — ghost button
3. **Inline CTA**: Mid-page prompt in surface-colored card
4. **Urgency CTA**: Gradient banner with time-sensitive messaging

## Editorial guardrails

- Prefer short sentences and active voice.
- Avoid broad claims without measurable proof.
- Keep jargon minimal on public pages.
- Never use "revolutionary," "game-changing," or "disruptive."
- Numbers are always better than adjectives: "500+ marketers" not "many marketers."
- Always pair a feature with a benefit: "Over-budget alerts (so you catch overspend before it compounds)."
- CTAs should feel like an invitation, not a demand.
