# Positioning Brief: Agency Track

## Ideal customer profile

Marketing agencies (5-50 people) running multi-client budgets across paid search, paid social, display, video, and organic channels. The day-to-day operator is a media buyer or account strategist who juggles 5-20 client budgets in spreadsheets and needs real-time pacing visibility.

## Pain

- Client budgets spread across platforms with no single pacing view.
- Manual spend reconciliation burns hours every week and errors slip through.
- Over-budget incidents erode client trust and margin.

## Promise

Connect once to Marketer MCP and give every client account real-time budget pacing, channel allocation guidance, and campaign QA — through the same AI workflows your team already uses.

## Proof

- Budget Buddy returns variance alerts in under 200ms via a single API call.
- Auth and rate controls are built in so each client workspace stays isolated.
- JSON-in, JSON-out design plugs into any automation layer your team runs today.

## Hero copy variant (A/B test)

**Headline:** "One endpoint. Every client budget under control."

**Sub-headline:** "Marketer MCP gives agencies real-time spend pacing, channel allocation, and campaign QA — no new dashboard required."

## CTA variant

- Primary: "Get early access for your agency"
- Secondary: "See how Budget Buddy works"

## Key differentiators for agency messaging

1. Multi-client isolation with namespaced tool execution.
2. Workflow-native: works inside the AI assistants and automations agencies already use.
3. No per-seat pricing friction — one MCP endpoint scales to any team size.
