# Marketer MCP

## What it is

Marketer MCP is a public hub of AI tools built for marketing operations. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard so AI assistants can discover and call marketing-specific tools through a single endpoint.

## Who it is for

Marketing leaders, marketing ops teams, and agencies who manage budgets across paid search, paid social, display, video, and organic channels. Both in-house teams (3-30 people) and agencies (5-50 people) managing multi-client budgets.

## How it works

You connect your MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or any MCP client) to the Marketer MCP endpoint. The assistant discovers available tools and can call them with structured JSON inputs. Tool execution requires Bearer token authentication. Discovery can be public.
