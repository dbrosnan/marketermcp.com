        <h1>Why Budget Buddy is our first tool</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">February 2026</p>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>When we interviewed marketing leaders about their biggest operational pain points, one theme dominated: budget visibility. Not strategy. Not creative. The simple question of "are we on track this month?" was consistently the hardest to answer quickly.</p>

          <h2>The spreadsheet problem</h2>

          <p>Most teams track budgets in spreadsheets. Someone pulls spend from each platform, pastes it into a tab, and compares it to the plan. This happens weekly at best, monthly at worst. By the time the spreadsheet is updated, the opportunity to course-correct has passed.</p>

          <h2>Why this is an MCP problem</h2>

          <p>Budget pacing is a perfect fit for tool-based AI. The input is structured (monthly budget, channel-level spend). The output is structured (variance percentages, over-budget flags, channel rollups). There is no ambiguity that requires human judgment at the calculation layer — only at the decision layer.</p>

          <p>Budget Buddy takes JSON in, returns JSON out. It plugs into any AI assistant that supports MCP. You ask your assistant "how is the budget looking?" and it calls Budget Buddy, gets a structured answer, and tells you in plain language — with the numbers to back it up.</p>

          <h2>What comes next</h2>

          <p>Budget Buddy is the foundation. Once teams have real-time pacing, the natural next questions are: "Should I reallocate?" (Channel Allocation Planner), "Are my campaigns set up correctly?" (Attribution QA), and "Does this creative meet spec?" (Creative QA). Each of those becomes the next tool on the hub.</p>

          <p>We started with the problem that came up in every single conversation. The rest of the roadmap follows the same principle: build what marketers actually need, in the order they need it.</p>
