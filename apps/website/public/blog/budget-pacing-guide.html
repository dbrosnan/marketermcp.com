        <h1>The marketer's guide to budget pacing</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">February 2026</p>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>Budget pacing is the practice of tracking actual spend against planned spend throughout a period — daily, weekly, or monthly — so you can adjust before it is too late. It sounds simple. In practice, most marketing teams only discover pacing problems at month-end reconciliation.</p>

          <h2>Why pacing matters</h2>

          <p>Over-pacing means you blow through budget early, leaving days or weeks with no active media. Under-pacing means unspent budget that could have driven pipeline. Both cost you revenue.</p>

          <p>The gap between "on track" and "off track" compounds quickly. A 5% daily overspend becomes 15% by week three. By the time a manual spreadsheet catches it, the damage is done.</p>

          <h2>The pacing formula</h2>

          <p>At its core, budget pacing compares two numbers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Expected spend to date</strong> = (monthly budget / days in month) * days elapsed</li>
            <li><strong>Actual spend to date</strong> = sum of all channel spend reported so far</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The variance (actual minus expected, as a percentage) tells you whether to accelerate, hold, or pull back.</p>

          <h2>Common pacing mistakes</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Checking pacing weekly instead of daily when spend is volatile.</li>
            <li>Ignoring channel-level breakdowns — total spend can look fine while one channel is 40% over.</li>
            <li>Using platform-reported spend without accounting for reporting lag (most platforms lag 24-72 hours).</li>
            <li>Not setting up alerts for threshold breaches (over 10% variance should trigger a review).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Automate pacing with Budget Buddy</h2>

          <p>Budget Buddy, the first tool on Marketer MCP, takes your monthly budget and channel-level spend as a JSON input and returns a pacing report with over-budget alerts. It runs in under 200ms and integrates into any AI workflow.</p>

          <p>Instead of opening a spreadsheet, you call a tool. Instead of waiting for a weekly check-in, you get real-time variance detection. That is what automated pacing looks like.</p>
