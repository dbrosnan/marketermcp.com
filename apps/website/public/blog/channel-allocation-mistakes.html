          <p>Channel allocation — how you split your budget across paid search, paid social, display, video, and organic — is one of the highest-leverage decisions a marketing team makes. Get it wrong and you waste budget quietly for months before the pipeline gap shows up in revenue.</p>

          <h2>1. Anchoring to last quarter's split</h2>

          <p>The most common allocation method is "what we did last time, plus or minus 5%." This ignores changing CPAs, seasonal demand shifts, and new channel opportunities. Allocation should be recalculated monthly based on performance data, not inherited from previous plans.</p>

          <h2>2. Over-indexing on a single efficiency metric</h2>

          <p>Optimizing purely for lowest CPA can starve upper-funnel channels that drive future pipeline. Paid social and video often have higher CPAs but contribute to brand awareness that lowers paid search CPAs over time. Allocation needs to account for the full funnel.</p>

          <h2>3. Ignoring diminishing returns</h2>

          <p>Every channel has a saturation point. Doubling your paid search budget does not double your conversions. Watch for marginal CPA increases — when the next dollar in a channel costs 20% more than the last, it is time to reallocate.</p>

          <h2>4. No test budget</h2>

          <p>Allocating 100% of budget to known channels means you never discover what is next. Reserve 5-10% for testing new channels, audiences, or formats. This is how teams find their next best-performing channel.</p>

          <h2>5. Quarterly reallocation cycles</h2>

          <p>Markets move faster than quarterly planning cycles. By the time you reallocate, the opportunity has passed. Monthly reallocation with weekly pacing checks gives you the agility to capture changes in demand.</p>

          <h2>Fix it with data, not gut feel</h2>

          <p>Marketer MCP's upcoming Channel Allocation Planner will take your spend and performance data and suggest reallocation moves based on CPA and ROAS thresholds. Budget Buddy already gives you the pacing visibility to know when a channel is off track.</p>
