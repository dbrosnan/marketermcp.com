        <h1>What Is MCP and Why Marketers Should Care</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">February 2026</p>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>If you have been watching AI tools evolve, you have probably heard the term MCP. Model Context Protocol is quickly becoming the standard that lets AI assistants connect to real tools and data — and it matters for marketing teams more than you might think.</p>

          <h2>What is MCP?</h2>

          <p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how AI assistants discover, connect to, and call external tools. Think of it as a universal plug: instead of each AI tool building its own integrations to Google Ads, your CRM, or your budget spreadsheet, MCP provides a common interface. Tools that speak MCP can be discovered and used by any compatible AI assistant.</p>

          <p>For marketers, this means your AI assistant is no longer limited to generating copy or answering generic questions. It can call a budget pacing tool, check campaign performance, validate UTMs, or run allocation scenarios — all through a single protocol.</p>

          <h2>How MCP works</h2>

          <p>MCP defines a registry of tools. Each tool has typed inputs and outputs, so the AI knows exactly what to send and what to expect back. When you ask your assistant "how is our paid social budget pacing this month?", it does not guess. It calls the Budget Buddy tool, passes your channel data, and returns a structured answer: over-paced, under-paced, or on track — with percentages.</p>

          <p>The protocol handles authentication, so you connect once to an MCP hub and gain access to all the tools that hub exposes. No per-tool API keys. No brittle point-to-point integrations. One connection, many capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Why marketers should pay attention</h2>

          <p>Marketing operations have long suffered from integration sprawl. Your budget lives in spreadsheets. Spend data lives in platform dashboards. Attribution lives in yet another tool. Getting a coherent answer often requires manual pulls, copy-paste, and hope that the numbers line up.</p>

          <p>MCP-native tools change that. A hub like Marketer MCP exposes purpose-built tools for marketing workflows: budget pacing, channel allocation, UTM governance, creative QA. Your AI assistant becomes an operational partner that can orchestrate these tools on your behalf. Ask it to check pacing, validate UTMs for tomorrow's launch, or suggest reallocation — it calls the right tools and returns structured, actionable answers.</p>

          <h2>Getting started</h2>

          <p>You do not need to understand the protocol internals to benefit. What you need is an AI assistant that supports MCP (Claude, Cursor, and others are adding support) and a hub that exposes marketing-specific tools. Marketer MCP is built for exactly that: one endpoint, tools that speak the language of channels, budgets, and campaigns.</p>

          <p>Start with Budget Buddy for real-time budget pacing. Once you see how structured tools beat spreadsheets, the rest of the stack becomes obvious. MCP is not just a technical standard — it is the layer that makes AI-native marketing ops possible.</p>
