        <h1>Why we built Marketer MCP</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">February 2026</p>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>AI tools have transformed how developers ship code, how designers prototype, and how data teams query databases. But marketing teams? Most of the "AI for marketing" landscape is a chatbot bolted onto an existing dashboard.</p>

          <p>That is not good enough. Marketing operations is a discipline with real workflows: budget approvals, channel allocation decisions, campaign flighting, UTM governance, creative compliance checks. These workflows deserve structured, reliable tools — not chat windows that hallucinate metrics.</p>

          <h2>The MCP approach</h2>

          <p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives AI assistants the ability to call external tools with structured inputs and outputs. Instead of asking a chatbot to "check my budget," you call a tool that takes your spend data and returns a variance report with over-budget alerts. Deterministic. Auditable. Fast.</p>

          <p>Marketer MCP is a public hub of these tools, purpose-built for marketing teams. You connect once and get access to every tool in the registry through a single endpoint.</p>

          <h2>Why a hub, not a point solution</h2>

          <p>Marketing ops is not one task. It is budget pacing and channel allocation and attribution QA and creative compliance and audience planning. A point solution solves one of those. A hub solves all of them through the same connection, the same auth model, and the same automation layer.</p>

          <p>We built Marketer MCP because the work marketers do every day deserves the same quality of AI tooling that engineers have had for years. Budget Buddy is where we start. The roadmap goes much further.</p>
