        <h1>Why One MCP Hub Beats Five Point Integrations</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">February 2026</p>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>Every new tool in your stack adds an integration. A connector to your AI assistant. An API key to manage. A schema to maintain when the vendor changes something. Five tools mean five integrations — and five points of failure. One MCP hub changes the math: connect once, access many tools.</p>

          <h2>The cost of integration sprawl</h2>

          <p>Point integrations add up. Each one requires setup, authentication, and ongoing maintenance. When a platform updates its API, your connector breaks. When you add a new team member, they need access to each tool. When you switch AI assistants, you reconfigure everything from scratch.</p>

          <p>The hidden cost is cognitive load. Your team has to remember which tool does what, which dashboard to check, which API key goes where. The more integrations, the more context switching — and the less time spent on actual marketing work.</p>

          <h2>The hub model</h2>

          <p>An MCP hub exposes multiple tools through a single endpoint. You connect your AI assistant to the hub once. The hub handles authentication, tool discovery, and routing. You get access to Budget Buddy, Channel Allocation Planner, Attribution QA, Creative QA — whatever tools the hub exposes — without adding a new integration for each.</p>

          <p>One connection. Many capabilities. When a new tool is added to the hub, you gain access automatically. No new API keys. No new configuration. The hub is the integration layer; the tools are just capabilities it exposes.</p>

          <h2>Maintenance and upgrades</h2>

          <p>With point integrations, every vendor upgrade is your problem. With a hub, the hub maintainer handles compatibility. When Budget Buddy adds a new feature, you get it through the same connection. When the MCP protocol evolves, the hub is updated once — and all tools benefit.</p>

          <p>That reduces your maintenance burden significantly. You are not managing five different integration lifecycles. You are managing one.</p>

          <h2>Consistency and discoverability</h2>

          <p>A hub also provides consistency. All tools speak the same protocol. They use the same authentication model. They follow the same patterns for inputs and outputs. Your AI assistant can discover and call any tool on the hub without learning a new interface for each.</p>

          <p>That makes it easier to add new workflows. "Check pacing" calls Budget Buddy. "Validate UTMs" calls Attribution QA. "Suggest reallocation" calls Channel Allocation Planner. One mental model, many tools.</p>

          <h2>When to choose a hub</h2>

          <p>Choose a hub when you need multiple related capabilities from a single domain. Marketing ops is a perfect fit: budget pacing, allocation, attribution, creative QA — these are all part of the same workflow. A hub like Marketer MCP bundles them so you connect once and get the full set.</p>

          <p>Five point integrations might have made sense when there was no alternative. With MCP hubs, there is. One connection beats five — every time.</p>
